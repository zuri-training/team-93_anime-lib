      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Anim8 is an open-source library filled with premade cross-browser CSS
        animations ready to take your project to the next level. Anim8 allows
        users to import or download web animations for faster development in
        normal language.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="why-anim8">WHY "Anim8"?</h3>
      <p>
        With anim8 you simply have the best at your fingertips with just a few
        words added to your class list - perfect for beginners, and those who
        simply want to do simple animations at break record timings. To name a
        few more:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Anim8 can be used as a cross-browser animation library in your online
            projects. Excellent for leading hints, home pages, sliders, and
            emphasis. They are compact files that function on desktops and can be
            resized without losing quality.
            </li>
            <li>
            One of the many methods to utilize Anim8 is to copy and paste the
            effect into your own CSS or to reference the stylesheet. Then, simply
            add the effect's class name to the element you want it to be applied
            to.
            </li>
            <li>It has a very modest file size.</li>
            <li>
            Use your favourite tools without jumping through endless hoops to
            ensure compatibility. Anim8 "just works". We worry about compatibility
            so that you don’t need to. Another headache is solved.
            </li>
            <li>
            Exposes animation elements and parameters to use as targeting elements
            to add interactivity and manipulate at run-time.
            </li>

        guys i noticed stuff i dont need those codes for < >
        in a p tag i just put it like that.

        If you are new to this and want to get up and running in say 10min or so
        check the <a href="/Documentation/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>. 
        If you are interested in finding more information,
        especially about the animations we provide, our technical reference
        serves your purpose. If you feel the defaults aren’t your style and you
        want to change them do check the how-to guides. Lastly, if you’re
        curious and want to know how it all works the nuts and bolts and
        everything in between do check <a href="/Documentation/how-it-all-works.html">How it all works</a>.
        <strong>! Important</strong> - In all
        code snippets shown anything you see in between <...> is variable, just
        so you know. And now another important thing…
      </p><br>
      <h3 id="the-anim8-case">THE ANIM8 CASE</h3>
      <p>
        Since our purpose is to better the developer's life we have considered a case,
         how do we know which class belongs to which library
        (eg. bootstrap) assuming you want to use some other library so we use a special case 
        " _className".
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
        Now to the meat...
